1234567-8

4/5/2006

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Ms. Smith is a 43-year-old woman with past medical history that includes a pilonidal cyst.
Sentence: This was apparently removed when she was 18.
Sentence: Last July she presented with more pain in this area.
Sentence: On exam, it was apparently unclear if there was a recurrence.
Sentence: She was put on a course of Keflex and everything resolved.
Sentence: She presents to walk-in today saying that same thing has happened.
Sentence: She has had a couple days of increased swelling in this area.
Sentence: No fevers.
Sentence: Mild pain.
Sentence: Bowel movements are fine.
Sentence: PHYSICAL EXAMINATION: BP 122/74, pulse 82.
Sentence: She is afebrile.
Sentence: We had a female nurse chaperone in the room during the exam.
Sentence: In the upper aspect of her gluteal cleft there were several scars from her prior surgery.
Sentence: This area was mildly indurated.
Sentence: There was absolutely no erythema or fluctuance and it was not tender at all.
Sentence: No drainage.
Sentence: ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: Possible recurrence of pilonidal cyst.
Sentence: We do not see any active evidence of an infection, but given her apparent response last July, we will give her another one-week course of Keflex.
Sentence: She will return to clinic if things do not resolve or if they get worse.
Sentence: Nancy Student, MS3

Sentence: E)  Left breast, lumpectomy:
- Breast tissue with healing biopsy site, florid proliferative
breast disease and multifocal lobular carcinoma in-situ.
Sentence: - No residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in-situ
identified.

Sentence: - No residual invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinoma in-situ
identified.
Sentence: (E) The previous biopsies (GHS03-5466) are reviewed and
show ductal carcinoma in-situ and multiple foci of infiltrating of
carcinoma with features of infiltrating lobular carcinoma.
Sentence: An exact
tumor size is difficult to ascertain, but is estimated at
approximately 1.5 cm.
